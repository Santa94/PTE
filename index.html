        <p>Hi Carla </p>
        <p>
            I hope all’s well with you. It’s been a busy time here and I’m looking forward to<br> going on holiday next week. I really need a break now, especially after the horrendous<br> week I’ve had.As you know, over the past few weeks I’ve sent out
            loads of job<br> applications.I’ve been wanting<br> to move on for quite a while now, and have basically<br> been sending my CV outto any company that looks even vaguely interesting. Some<br> have been in answer to advertisements and others
            just on spec as you never know. The<br> feedback has been quite positive in general (if they bother to answer at all) but I must<br> tell you about the last interview I had. It was my worst nightmare!
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, it was pouring with rain. I’d planned what I was going to wear so I could<br> tick that off the list but in the end I had to rethink as I’d been intending to wear a <br> white skirt. Couldn’t risk it! And then there’s always
            the question of what to do with<br> your umbrella and everything is damp. Not a disaster really I know, but somehow I<br> took it as a sign. Luckily there were plenty of buses, so I got to the offices in good<br> time, and checked in with
            the receptionist – who was less than friendly. She waved<br> me over to the waiting area and didn’t even offer me a coffee. By this point I was<br> starting to feel a littleuncomfortable.You know when your gut instinct is telling you<br> that
            something’s not quite right.The general atmosphere wasn’t very welcoming, and<br> no one seemed to have time to exchange a few words.
        </p>
        <p>
            By this point I knew that I didn’t want the job so I decided to see the interview as<br> a useful experience. They asked all the usual questions, you know, about working well<br> in a team, using initiative, being a people person, keeping
            calm under pressure etc. Of<br> course I answered positively and then even asked them a few questions about the<br> position I was applying for and the structure of the company. And guess what, a<br> couple of days later I got a letter with
            the usual ‘we regret to inform you …’ but I can<br> only say I was relieved, although it would have been good to have been able to turn<br> them down. Hopefully by the next time we see each other I’ll have a new job. Fingers<br> crossed!
            <br> Take care and write soon.<br> Love
            <br> Sandi
